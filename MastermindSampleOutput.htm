<p>Welcome to Mastermind.<br>
<br>
This is a text version of the classic board game Mastermind.<br>
The computer will think of a secret code.<br>
The code consists of 4 colored pegs.<br>
The pegs may be one of six colors: blue, green , orange, purple, red, or yellow.<br>
A color may appear more than once in the code.<br>
<br>
You try to guess what colored pegs are in the code and what order they are in<br>
After making a guess the result will be displayed.<br>
A result consists of a black peg for each peg you have exactly correct (color 
and position) in your guess.<br>
For each peg in the guess that is the correct color, but is out of position, you 
get a white peg.<br>
<br>
Only the first letter of the color is displayed. B for Blue, R for Red, and so 
forth.<br>
When entering guesses you only need to enter the first character of the color as 
a capital letter.<br>
<br>
You have 12 to guess the answer or you lose the game.<br>
